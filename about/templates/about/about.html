                In the beginning, during the growing pains of a new art, Skateboarders were few and far between, we were hungry for inspiration, 
                watching every single minute of new tricks and styles we could find. For us though, it wasn't enough to be passive 
                consumers of this booming culture of physical expression. We knew we had to travel great distances to find like minded people who 
                loved to move and saw the world differently like we did. In a world where we feel like theres nothing new to be found, we 
                uncovered new worlds in our own urban back yards. Thats how Skate Shop came about. We were a group of friends from different 
                corners of the country coming together to travel, explore and create.

                All too often we'd find ourselves sleeping shoulder to shoulder with a dozen friends on the floor of some apartment in a foreign land,
                eagerly anticipating whatever adventure would present itself. We would travel, skate, shoot and share everything we did with the world
                wide community. Not just the tricks but the lifestyle that being a vagabond skateboarder had to offer, and have the time of our lives 
                while doing it.

                That's what being a skateboarder is about. Being outside the norm is a chance to live creatively, and love what you do. Life is too 
                valuable to waste time doing what you're not passionate about and we want to use our time to create and experience the lifestyle 
                skateboarding has to offer us. We've taken the values we learned from being skateboarders and applied it to everything in our lives,
                from making videos to fashion. Skate Shop Clothing strives to be creative, authentic, and show love for the details in everything we
                produce. We create fashion for the modern urban athlete, aesthetically clean and practical.
