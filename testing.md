# Testing

To test the responsiveness of my site, i used Chrome devtools. This makes sure that the site is run on a variety of different devices and screen sizes.

To make sure that the site is fit for purpose, all user stories and features documented in the main README.md file will be tested. The test procedures and results are documented below.
